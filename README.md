# Find-the-Treasure
This is my first js program I've made by using a book (JavaScript pour les kids: DÃ¨s 10 ans) Yes, from 10 years. Just to be able to learn it in a easy, funny and especially not painful way. So in this project, the player just have to try to find the treasure in less than 10 clics.
