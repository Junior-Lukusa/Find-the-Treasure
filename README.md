# Find-the-Treasure

## Description
This is my first js program I've made by using a book (JavaScript pour les Kids: DÃ¨s 10 ans). Yes, from 10 years :-). It was just to be able to learn it in a easy, funny and especially not painful way. So in this project, the player just has to try to find the treasure in less than 10 clics. Enjoy
